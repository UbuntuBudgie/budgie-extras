## Standalone

budgie mini-apps - see the individual components for details

 - Budgie Extras Daemon
 - Budgie Wallstreet
 - Budgie Quickchar (needs the extras daemon as a runtime dependency)
 - Budgie Window Previews (needs the extras daemon as a runtime dependency)
 - Budgie Shuffler (needs the extras daemon as a runtime dependency)
 - Budgie Hotcorners (needs shuffler daemon as a runtime dependency for full functionality)
 
 ## Installation

 By default all recommended applets are compiled and installed:

     git clone https://github.com/ubuntubudgie/budgie-extras
     cd budgie-extras
     git submodule init
     git submodule update

     mkdir build && cd build
     meson --buildtype plain --prefix=/usr --libdir=/usr/lib
     ninja -v
     sudo ninja install

If individual applets (or groups of applets) are to be compiled and installed use
the options described in meson_options.txt i.e. use `-Dbuild-recommended=false -Dbuild-appletoption=true`

e.g. to build just the hotcorners and weathershow applets
(remember to git clone and git submodule etc as above)

     mkdir build && cd build
     meson --buildtype plain -Dbuild-recommendee=false -Dbuild-hotcorners=true -Dbuild-weathershow=true --prefix=/usr --libdir=/usr/lib
     ninja -v
     sudo ninja install

## Distros

We love Budgie-Extras to work across as many distros as possible.  Budgie Extras should be packaged as individual applets - NOT as one "budgie-extras" package, so that end users can install one or more applets.  Please let us know if your distro has packaged budgie-extras and how to install each applet.

 - Arch - https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/budgie-extras/ NOTE - this installs everything rather than allowing per applet installation
 - Ubuntu - use the ubuntu-budgie-welcome snap - and install via Menu - Budgie Applets
 - Debian - packages are available in Buster/Bullseye named "budgie-insertname-applet" https://goo.gl/R4eF7q
 - Gentoo - Overlay for budgie desktop including budgie-extras https://gitlab.com/SarahMia/sarahmiaoverlay
